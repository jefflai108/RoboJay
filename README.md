# RoboJay
Sensor code written in Arduino for an autonomous campus tour robot - RoboJay. 

This is a project that I worked on from March to September 2016. I mainly worked on the sensor code and testing. Below is the project description written by our lead (Max Novick): 

"As circumspection increases in students deciding which college to attend, the ability to present the most attractive features of Johns Hopkins University in an effective manner becomes more desirable. Campus tours are one of the most effective ways to showcase JHU, but tour guides vary in effectiveness. Our robot, “RoboJay,” will maximize campus tour effectiveness, because it will have the personal experiences of every tour guide at its disposal and, in a potential later version, have the answer to any conceivable question a prospective student might ask."
